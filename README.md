# character-controller

the characterController script is my oun design. i designed it for third Person platformer. 
very easy to use just make the camera a child to the player and your ready to go.
the camera and character will rotate with the mouse and slide side to side, forword and backword with WASD

most controllers i found tend to be static and force you to move on the Axis, this one will let you move forward using W the direction you are faceing.
this is a Rigidbody controller


thr Grapple Gun uses a Line Renderer to attach and swing on objects labeled ground

breakable script is super simple script that will destroy an object after a set amount of time
